API Advanced Project
Description
The API Advanced project focuses on working with APIs, specifically using the Reddit API. You’ll learn how to query endpoints, handle pagination, parse JSON results, make recursive API calls, and sort dictionaries by value.

Background Context
API-related questions are common in interviews. Whether it’s a simple task like querying an endpoint or a more complex challenge involving recursion and data manipulation, understanding APIs is crucial. The Reddit API provides a great opportunity for practice, as it offers various endpoints without requiring authentication.

Learning Objectives
By working on this project, you’ll be able to:

Read API documentation to find relevant endpoints.
Use APIs with pagination.
Parse JSON data returned by APIs.
Make recursive API calls when needed.
Sort dictionaries based on values.

Requirements
Editors: You can use vi, vim, or emacs.
Environment: Your code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.4.3).
New Lines: Ensure that all your files end with a new line.
Shebang: The first line of all your files should be #!/usr/bin/python3.
Organized Imports: Libraries imported in your Python files must be organized in alphabetical order.
README.md: A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
PEP 8 Style: Follow the PEP 8 style guide.
Executable Files: All your files must be executable.
File Length: The length of your files will be tested using wc.
Module Documentation: Each module should have a documentation string (use python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)').
