0x15 API Python Scripting Back-end
Description
This project focuses on building a Python-based back-end for an API. Whether youâ€™re creating a RESTful API, a web service, or any other type of API, a well-documented README will help users understand your project and get started quickly.

Features
Python Scripting: The back-end is written in Python, leveraging its powerful libraries and frameworks.
API Design: Describe the purpose and functionality of your API. What endpoints does it expose? What data can users retrieve or manipulate?
Authentication and Authorization: Explain how users can authenticate and authorize themselves to use the API.
Installation and Setup: Provide step-by-step instructions for setting up the project locally.
Dependencies: List any external libraries or packages required to run the back-end.
Usage Examples: Include code snippets demonstrating how to make requests to your API.
Contributing Guidelines: Encourage other developers to contribute to your project.
License: Specify the license under which your project is released.
Installation
Prerequisites:
Make sure you have Python installed (version X.X or higher).
Install any necessary dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x15-api-python.git
cd 0x15-api-python

Run the Back-end:
Execute the main Python script to start the API server:
python app.py

The API will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.
API Endpoints
