Project Title: 0x04. Loops, Conditions and Parsing
Overview
This project focuses on enhancing your skills in shell scripting, specifically in the areas of loops, conditions, and parsing. By the end of this project, you should be adept at using SSH keys, various loops (while, until, for), conditional statements (if, else, elif, case), and the cut command. Additionally, you'll gain proficiency in file and other comparison operators, making your scripts portable and compatible with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
