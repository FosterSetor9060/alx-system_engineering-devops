Overview ðŸš€
Monitoring is a crucial aspect of maintaining the health and performance of web servers. It involves tracking and analyzing various metrics to ensure both the application and server are operating optimally. In this project, we explore two main areas of monitoring:

Application Monitoring:
Involves tracking and analyzing data related to the running software.
Ensures the application behaves as expected.
Monitors metrics like response times, error rates, and resource consumption.
Server Monitoring:
Focuses on evaluating the health of the server, whether virtual or physical.
Monitors various aspects such as CPU usage, memory usage, disk activity, and network performance.
Aims to prevent server overload and optimize resource utilization.
