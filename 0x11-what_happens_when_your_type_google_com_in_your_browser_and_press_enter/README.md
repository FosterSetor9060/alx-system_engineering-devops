DNS Lookup
When you enter "google.com" in your browser, the first step is a DNS (Domain Name System) lookup. The browser sends a query to a DNS server to translate the human-readable domain name ("google.com") into a machine-readable IP address. This is done because computers and network devices use IP addresses to communicate, not domain names.

TCP Connection Establishment
Once the DNS lookup is complete and the IP address of "google.com" is obtained, the browser initiates a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with the server hosting Google's website. This involves a three-way handshake between the client (your computer) and the server to establish a reliable connection.

HTTP Request and Response
After the TCP connection is established, the browser sends an HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) request to the server. This request includes details such as the HTTP method (e.g., GET), the URL ("google.com"), headers (e.g., User-Agent), and any additional data if necessary.

The server receives the request and processes it. It generates an HTTP response, which typically includes headers and the HTML content of the Google homepage. The response is sent back to the browser over the established TCP connection.

Rendering the Web Page
Upon receiving the HTTP response, the browser starts rendering the web page. It parses the HTML content, fetches any additional resources (such as images, CSS files, or JavaScript files), and lays out the page according to the HTML and CSS specifications.

During this rendering process, the browser also executes any JavaScript code that is included in the page, which can dynamically modify the content or behavior of the web page.

Caching and Optimization
To improve performance, both the browser and the server may employ caching mechanisms. For example, the browser may cache the DNS lookup results, the HTTP responses, or certain web page assets (like images or scripts) locally to reduce the need for repetitive downloads.

Additionally, the server may implement optimizations such as content delivery networks (CDNs) to distribute content from servers closer to the user geographically, or compression techniques to reduce the size of transferred data.

Conclusion
In summary, typing "google.com" in your browser and pressing Enter triggers a series of steps involving DNS lookup, TCP connection establishment, HTTP request and response, rendering the web page, and potential caching and optimization techniques. This process allows your browser to retrieve and display the Google homepage, providing a seamless user experience.
